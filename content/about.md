Hello and welcome to my tech corner!

I'm Reza Seyf, a tech enthusiast with more than 6 years of practical experience in the software world. Since I was a kid, I loved taking apart my toys to see how they worked. That curiosity from my early years has turned into a strong passion for understanding and creating technology.

In this blog, I aim to share what I've learned in a simple way.

Come along with me as we explore the wonders of coding and technology through my perspective, and maybe even reignite that childhood curiosity in you!
